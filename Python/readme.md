# Python Analytical Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing a collection of data science and machine learning projects. Below is an overview of each project along with a brief description of their functionalities and insights.

## Projects

### 1. Customer Shopping EDA
#### Notebook: Customer_Shopping_EDA.ipynb

##### This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer shopping dataset. The goal is to understand the purchasing behavior of customers, identify trends, and extract meaningful insights that can help in decision-making processes for marketing and sales strategies.

#### Key Highlights:
##### Data cleaning and preprocessing
##### Univariate and bivariate analysis
##### Visualization of shopping patterns and trends
##### Insights on customer segmentation and preferences

### 2. IMBD Sentiment Analysis
#### Notebook: IMBD_sentimental_analysis.ipynb

##### In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The primary objective is to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.

#### Key Highlights:
##### Text preprocessing and tokenization
##### Feature extraction using TF-IDF
##### Model building using various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
##### Evaluation of model performance
##### Visualization of sentiment distribution

### 3. K-Means Clustering - Clustering IPL Batsmen & Bowlers
#### Notebook: K means Clustering - Clustering IPL Batsmen & Bowlers.ipynb

##### This project applies K-means clustering algorithm to cluster IPL batsmen and bowlers based on their performance metrics. The aim is to categorize players into distinct groups to identify similar performance patterns.

#### Key Highlights:
##### Data preprocessing and normalization
##### Selection of optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method
##### Application of K-means clustering
##### Visualization of clusters
##### Interpretation of clusters to gain insights into player performance

### 4. Customer Churn Prediction
#### Notebook: customer_churn.ipynb

##### The focus of this project is to predict customer churn for a telecom company. By analyzing customer data, we aim to build a model that can identify customers who are likely to churn.

#### Key Highlights:
##### Data cleaning and feature engineering
##### Handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE
##### Model building using classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
##### Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC
##### Insights on important features affecting churn

### 5. Text Analysis Utilities
#### Script: text_analysis.py

##### This script provides utilities for various text analysis tasks. It includes functions for text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and other common natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

#### Key Highlights:
##### Text cleaning and normalization functions
##### Tokenization and lemmatization utilities
##### Sentiment analysis using pre-trained models
##### Helper functions for feature extraction
